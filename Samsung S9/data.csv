5,Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far,01-Apr-18,Yes,"I am a die hard Apple person. All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime. Not a huge deal and I can use the DUO app from Google which is the same as FaceTime. The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. I like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). I think the new iPhone X does this too but again, I'm coming from a 5s. My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X. The X would have cost me $1150 plus an AppleCare warranty for $200. I got this Samsung (and got the Ultimate Play Bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. Took out a Square Trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should I need to use it. I have used Square Trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. Square Trade is owned by Allstate so I have confidence in them. Getting back to the phone, the S9+ seems to work VERY fast when loading apps and pages. I use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (Nest thermostat, wireless cameras, LIFX lights, Liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. The audio when playing music sounds great. Plays very loud and clear for a phone. I like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. I like the Android system as it comes with Google Assistant voice command. Most people hate the Bixby feature on this phone. My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes. I do like though that i's voice activated. I get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up Bixby and command it to open up whatever app I need (usually Waze). Once open, I speak to Waze to take me to work. All of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. Also, the Bixby AI camera function is very cool too. There are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. Like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to English or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). Point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. Point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). The ONLY thing I think I will never use again and of course I tried it out is the Animoji of myself or any of my friends. It's scary weird. Everyone looks the same on this. I would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3D type and look more realistic. I have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. Mot notably the iPhone X. In my opinion, the X does do a lot of pix better. The contrast is usually better. The real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. So, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iPhone X. The only thing I had to get used to is the colors on a Samsung phone are very oversaturated. Colors are very bright. There is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. I turned it down to one of them and it now looks a LOT more realistic. I like the fact that this phone, as well as the iPhone X, features ability to record video at 4K 60fps. Looks great. On the Samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4K 60fps. Keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. For all other video formats, the stabilization on the Samsung works better than the X. All in all, I am happy I went with the Samsung. In a few months if I regret it, I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus...UPDATE: 4/7/2018.  The voice unlock code is terrible. And, after searching through the options on the phone I came to the conclusion I don't need it. I have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. I actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. One thing I find annoying that I didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. Whether I send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. This is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. I was used to having an iPhone and using iMessage. Send any size video to someone else with an iPhone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. Not so with Android. Now this is not just Samsung but all Android phones. So, for now, I have to send videos via WhatsApp or Viber (or a number of other text apps). They do compress but not horribly. Oh, and one more note. I hope Samsung corp is reading this review. The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company. I used to think Comcast was bad until I called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at Samsung. They just repeat my question and tell me they understand how I feel offering absolutely no answers. They put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. Just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at AppleCare when I had a question about my iPhone or iMac computer...2nd UPDATE: I didn't  realize this and this is VERY important to know before purchasing. In fact, I'm on the AT&amp;T; network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. The sales people in Best Buy in the phone department did not know this either. When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9+, your phone is $840. If however you want to buy it thru AT&amp;T; for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. Meaning, the unlocked phone WILL NOT have: WIFI calling option, HD Audio option, VVM (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. The option for these features is not even on my phone. Now, you CAN buy the AT&amp;T; phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). After you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the AT&amp;T; phone unlocked and then you will have these features. Nowhere at Best Buy or any AT&amp;T; store do they tell you this. In my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. I picked up the bundle package here on Amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so I'm keeping my setup. I just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. I figured the AT&amp;T; version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. Hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. And, I went to the AT&amp;T; store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. There isn't. They cannot update your phone to get these options...3rd UPDATE: April 15th, 2018.I discovered a great feature today. I wish these Galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iPhone X has. You pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. What I discovered is setting the Google Assistant to open the Galaxy EVEN FROM the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the Google Assistant to do. Love this feature immensely...4th UPDATE April 23, 2018.As I play around more with this phone, I am learning some cool things it can do. For instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. No need for repetition with swiping either up or down. There is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from Samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. Even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). Also, one thing Samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the Oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. Now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control MEDIA volume no matter what you are viewing. And, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the MEDIA volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. Apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the Galaxy phones that is now solved.",632

5,It works!,22-Apr-18,Yes,"MetroPCS initially had issues getting it added to my account, but I woke up the next morning and it was working fine. So, if anyone is wondering it DOES work on MetroPCS/T-Mobile network! :) IN the USA [I'm in St. Louis, MO",88

5,Switched from iPhone,16-Mar-18,No,"I switched to the s9 after I saw the price of the iPhoneX. I am not disappointed with switching to Samsung, this phone has a much better display and camera than the iPhones do. The pictures in the dark are phenomenal. It was easy to transfer all the data from my iPhone because of the easy set up features. If your thinking about switching from the iPhone, do it, you will not be disappointed.",208

4,Good phone except for Bixby and Samsung bloatware.,12-May-18,Yes,"I've had many Samsung phones and liked them.  But my most recent phone was an LG V20, which I was also very happy with.  The camera glass cracked after 2 years, and I decided to get another Samsung.  Overall this is a great phone. I wish it was a little larger, so the same screen resolution yielded larger text and icons.  I know I can adjust it, but on the V20 everything's a bit larger at the same resolution, because the usable screen is larger. But if you have good vision at that distance it won't bother you..One complaint I have is Bixby and the Samsung bloatware.  I bought this unlocked so I wouldn't have the carrier bloatware, but Samsung puts on plenty of their own, and along with Bixby, you can't delete most of it, just disable it.  It continues to nag me to use one of the apps.  I don't know why they want to cram this down the user's throat.  I already bought the phone.  If I thought Samsung had better apps, I'd download them.  But none of their built in apps are better than Google stock apps or other 3rd party. I'm not sure what the reason is for trying to push their apps on users.  I guess to avoid this  you have to buy a Google phone.",50

5,Love it!,18-Mar-18,Yes,Upgraded from the s6. Love it! Fingerprint on back is cool and hidden home button is good too. Activated verizon set up all online super easy. I bought a caseology case and screen protector. Needed to change the touch screen sensitivity to make it normal (for a while it was difficult to type).,68

5,Beautiful phone!,17-Mar-18,No,"My husband bought me this phone in the lilac purple color for my birthday,...it's gorgeous! I love the display and the infinity edge. For me this is a total upgrade from the S5 I've been using, I'm so glad I waited! Everything shows up bright and crystal clear. Even my email looks nicer!..The emojis you make using the camera do turn out a bit creepy,...they look like you but not really. At my age I don't think this is something I see myself using too often in chat or messenger. It's fun for all of maybe 10 minutes...The camera is nice, the pictures come out clean and clear. However I do wish all the features were explained a bit more in the manual  to make it easier to figure out. It's nice being able to scroll through the different modes with a swipe of your finger but the how-to's on using some of the different options would be nice if they were printed out in the manual for reference. I'm sure it would be easy enough to look on YouTube or Google,....Haha I suppose this is what happens when you go from an old phone and leap frog over a few generations and find yourself in the future. :p..I'm not too crazy about Bixby though, there should be a way to reassign the button to something else and remove the app entirely if you choose. I also like my camera settings set so you say ""Smile"", ""Shoot,"" ""Cheese"", ""Record video"", or another trigger word,... but unless you completely turn off the voice for Bixby  you can't use the voice command on the camera. One feature should not cancel out another,... maybe there will be a software update later on.  Or maybe I have completely missed the setting somewhere and will bump into it somewhere after I've used it more?..The speakers are excellent, music sounds great and phone calls come through very clear. Using speaker phone I actually had to turn call volume down, on my old phone it was hard to hear people talk and the mic didn't pick up very well either. Not the case here!..I love this phone!  It's a nice size, easy to hold, and looks great! It was also very easy to set up and after I played with it for awhile I found it simple to navigate with a few cool surprises thrown in for me to discover. Having read how similar this phone is to the S8 I can understand some people being annoyed at spending all their money and not really getting much more than they already had, but I did read before these were released  that they were similar and if I had an S8 I probably would not have bought this model. For the most part I still feel this is a great phone. I know for a fact I will have a great time taking pictures and videos of my kids and grandkids with it!..*3/21/18-  Added a few sample pictures,  one is a  close up (approx.12"" away, begging dog wanted my lunch), another a couple inches away, and the others from about 15 feet. No filters just had the camera set to auto and let it do its thing. Pictures come out clear and so much nicer than from my other phone. I've been playing with the other features as well and results are great too...Using the volume button to snap a quick picture is convenient, it makes taking pictures with this size phone so much easier. I'll have a great time using this camera when the grand kids visit!..The lock screen is a little annoying when you have to click the power button then do the swipe screen, but in a way it's useful, my old phone did all sorts of things on its own while tumbling around  in my bag. The hidden home button and the power button are both quick and responsive, either one quickly wakes the phone up but the home button brings up the home screen if you press it when the screen is off. You can always change the time out settings so your screen doesn't click off as fast to give you more time, so not really a big deal for me...This is a fun phone to have. Battery life for me is great, I keep the display on bright because it's just so pretty. I also have the time  out screen set for 5 minutes. I just charge my phone once a day and I'm good to go! No regrets with this phone.",156

5,The one,11-May-18,Yes,"Moved over from an iPhone 7 .If you can extract yourself from iOS (easier said than done), this is a great phone...Phone itself: excellent call quality. headphones are really nice and there is a headphone jack with no dongle and you don't HAVE to use bluetooth. charges so quickly...Camera: Fantastic in every way...Muzak: Am still a little confused on the various Samsung apps, esp Samsung Music which is so weird. Listening to music/ videos is really nice on this because of the full screen and the front facing speakers...Size: This is a great size ... perfect for me. I am a medium build person with medium sized hands. I did not want a phablet. This phone feels like something between an iPhone 7 and 7+ for comparison. Don't know how it actually compares but feels smaller than the iPhone +...Get a case on this thing. I am using the SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle ... it's thin and grippy.",19

5,Upgrading from s7,26-Mar-18,Yes,"Very nice upgrade from s7. I'm glad I went with the s9+ . I really like the big screen, and extra camera.",28
,,,,,
5,"Great upgrade from S6 era of phones, not from S8.",02-May-18,Yes,"This phone is leagues better than my S6 was, mostly due to refinement of the phone rather than innovation. It does everything you want it to, has a great camera, beautiful screen, and everything you've come to expect from a Samsung flagship...That said, it's not a massive improvement from the S8. It's more polished, but it is essentially the same phone...If your got a need to upgrade to a new device from a 3+ year old device, absolutely worth the investment. From a more modern phone, not so much.",31
,,,,,
4,Lilac S9+ .... What a Beauty,08-May-18,Yes,"I purchased the lilac purple phone Sunday afternoon and it was delivered Monday morning. The phone was new, no damages as others have talked about , with all parts and accessories included like you would get if you purchased it from Samsung.com. I also chose the bundle which included a 128 GB mini SD card as well as a Fast Wireless Charger stand. The bundle was at no extra cost so the price was $839 plus tax. Great deal if you ask me..  I am coming from a Samsung Note 8 and there are minor upgrades from the Note 8 but those minor upgrades was worth me buying the S9+ . The phone is snappy, the sound due to the dual speakers makes a world of a difference. The camera is better than my Note 8 and the AR emojis are fun. Once the Note 9 comes out, I will be sure to compare that against the S9+ but in the mean time, I will switch between this S9+ and my Note 8 as my daily driver. (Its something about the S pen on my Note 8 that I can not let go. Great phone. I would reccomend this device.",18

I just bought this Galaxy S9 and I can't find any company that will sell me a protection plan which covers loss or theft..Asurion seems to only sell warranties through phone carriers, Squaretrade doesn't cover theft, and it looks like Verizon won't sell me the coverage because I didn't buy the phone from them, also I'm not on contract. I'll update this if I have any luck, I'll probably just end up returning this and buying a phone from Verizon, even though I am mad at them :(...",7

4,"Happy, Happy",15-Apr-18,Yes,"Happy, Happy, Happy! Recommended that you still use a pin number or the finger scanner to unlock your phone and security pay type apps.

5,"Expensive, but worth every penny",29-Jun-18,Yes,"Light years better than any Apple iPhone product; so much more freedom and REAL user-friendly experience...it looks/acts like an actual computer. I can access any/all files, doesn't need any proprietary software...no hassles at all. The sound is really impressive with Samsung Music &amp; Dolby ATMOS too. USB-C charging is amazingly fast, expandable storage via MicroSDXC and the world's most amazing camera...the pricetag is a whopper at &gt;$700 for 64GB storage, but it is Android 8.0 (Oreo)...soon to upgrade to Android P.",3

3,You enjoyed having custom notification sounds for individual e-mails,06-Jul-18,Yes,"Too many missing features. You enjoyed having custom notification sounds for individual e-mails? Too bad, ""we're working on getting that feature back to you."" You want the Samsung e-mail app to automatically show you e-mails from longer than 6 months ago? Nope, you'll have to do a search. Does your VIP have more than one email address listed in his contacts? Oh, we'll just split them into two separate contacts when you import them into the email app! Oh, you want that person to show as only ONE contact? Too bad, that feature isn't available!.Honestly, the downgraded features make this ""upgraded"" phone average at best. Pay a premium price, get a standard phone. Great job, Samsung. I'll update this with a better review IF they put back these integral features.",1

5,Puchased this phone on pre-order back in March and have ...,31-May-18,Yes,"Puchased this phone on pre-order back in March and have been using it since the day I received it on Sprint. I was hesitant to purchase a phone outside of a Sprint store but it worked out well and there was only one hiccup in activating it. This phone does not come with a SIM, which apparently Sprint doesn't always carry in the store. After some searching a SIM was located and the associate switched my phones (S8 to S9) in about 10 minutes.",2
,,,,,
5,Love this!,11-May-18,Yes,"This is my most favorite phone! I can do so much with it. It was super simple to activate it with my carrier, I literally popped in my activated SIM card and was off and running. I have had it a few weeks now and I still keep finding more and more things to do with my phone. The purple color is amazing! I got mine as part of a bundle and still haven't used all the pieces. Great value too!",2
,,,,,
5,Nothing short of amazing!,21-Jul-18,Yes,"This phone is nothing short of amazing! It's my first top of the line premium phone, and I never knew, until now, what I'd been missing. It is blazing fast, the screen resolution is fantastic, and it can do so many things that I will be constantly discovering new functions. The dual speakers with the Dolby Atmos, sound so absolutely terrific, it's amazing that Samsung can pack so much sound into such small speakers. My last Samsung phone was a Galaxy Mega with the 6.3"" screen, and I loved the huge screen on it, and that is my only lament about the S9+, it has a 6.2"" screen, so you'd think it isn't that much smaller, but it is quite a bit smaller. Not length-wise, but smaller by a bunch height-wise, and I've missed that on every phone I've had since. That is the one thing that would make the S9+ absolutely perfect for me, a screen that big, but, I'll live without it in exchange for how great the rest of this phone is. I highly recommend this phone if you can possibly afford it, it's really outstanding.",0

4,"Samsung S7, A Good Pocket Computer and Telecommunications Device",13-May-18,Yes,"I upgraded to this Samsung S9 Model SM-G960U1 unlocked version from a Samsung S7.  The phone works just fine and the transfer of all my stuff from the old phone to the new went pretty well.  While the curved screen has a visual appeal I believe that a flat screen would be both more practical and easier to protect.  In terms of it being a tool, I haven't discovered anything new that this phone can do that the S7 couldn't do.  It comes with something called ""Bixby"" that I guess we're supposed to all just know what it is and what to do with it... guess I'm not interested in Bixby until I see some information that educates me on what it does and why I might need it... I do like Samsung phones and once you've grown accustomed to a company's android interface it makes sense to stay with what is familiar.  If you have an S7 or S8 there is probably no reason to upgrade to the S9 version unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket.  In my case, one of my son's needed a phone so he got my old S7 and I treated myself to a new phone.",12

My only complaint is that the glass is very, very, very sensitive to the hits, you  have to buy  a really good case for it. I had bought 2 Samsung Galaxy 8+ for my family.

So, Amazon was super helpful in exchanging the phone for another, saying the serial numbers must have been confused.  I try to activate the second one, and run into the same exact issue.  Sprint does NOT have the IMEIs of these phones on their list of eligible devices, regardless of everything (model/unlocked/unbranded) pointing to this phone being eligible.  Other carriers experience may vary.",0

Packaging was very good, and phone was in mint condition. Photo quality is awesome! This was one of my main reasons for purchasing this phone. I previously owned a Samsung S7. Some features have changed on the phone, for example the home button is no longer there, and has the Bixby feature which I am trying to figure out. Overall would highly recommend!",1

Dont let the model number fool you. The model number is the North American version. The ""1"" you see at the end, only means it's an unlocked phone. Everything was in the box. Excellent condition.

A super fast processor and an awesome camera that is above average. I especially like the speed with which the Intellegent Scanner and Fingerprint Scanner both work to unlock the screen. This comes in handy in situations where you need a quick peek at messages or other info on the notification panel. The best smartphone that Samsung has ever produced and definitely the best smartphone for 2018.,1

3,The speaker distorts really bad when the music is at high volume,18-Jul-18,Yes,"The speaker distorts really bad when the music is at high volume. The reason i bought this was for the camera and the new speakers. The camera's front flash when on whatsapp conversations does not work. If you need to send someone a picture, you have to go the the camera itself, take the picture then go back into whatsapp to send it. I mean its not a huge deal but i'd like if the front flash worked in whatsapp. All in all, good phone but mehhh!",0

The camera has great features, so if you use the camera function on your cell phone a lot, this is the phone for you!..The wireless charge function is probably the best part of this phone.  My last phone had the charging port go bad after 5 years of use (I loved the phone so much I used it until I just could not eek out another charge).  Not having to stick in a plug every day should make this a non issue for this S9...I could write an extensive technical review, but there are lots of those.  SO Ill stick with these two most practical features for the every day phone users!",3

3,Solid phone with issues.,25-Jun-18,Yes,"The Galaxy S8 Plus battery was great, this feels like a major step backward, as I needed to charge the phone at least 3 times just to get through 8-5...There are also major software problems too: the VPN simply refused to function after switched from Wi-Fi to cellular, requiring manual disconnect and reconnect to the VPN. My office has several Wi-Fi dead spots, as you can see it can get frustrating very quickly. Samsung support is virtually useless, they kept on saying it is not a problem...Now the good: camera is phenomenal, the best out there; performance is light years ahead of the S8, I don't even see the stuttering in the Google Play Store, that's how smooth the phone is...Overall, solid phone hindered by poor battery life and my personal issue with VPN according to Samsung, so I decided to deal with it as a customer who has an issue with the product: returning it. Guess I would use the S8 one more year.",2

Well obviously Samsung is the screen guru nowadays...Everything is great on this device, works much better than iphone in bluetooth connections, is extremely fast etc..UI is very good, and packed with options. Fast charging is impressive, 10 to 100 in 60 mins.

Works on the Verizon CDMA network and the data speed is noticeably faster than my previous iPhone 7+ on the same network.  Earphones that came with it sound great as well, which is a plus.  I have gone back and forth between Android and iPhone over the years.  My last Android was a Galaxy S5+ which was an energy hog.  Given the power of this phone I find the battery life impressive.",2

I had to have a friend of mine show me how to access the sim/micro sd card port.  Switched them out, turned on the phone.  It walked me through how to attach the included cable and attachment to my j3v.  Transferred and Bam! It works.  Went out to my carriers website and already show up.  No problems.  The only thing you can not do with your carrier (you should check with yours) is that you can not get insurance on a phone unless purchased through your carrier.

I've been used to the Galaxy's home button, and the back and multi-screen buttons, so it's interesting adapting to a completely smooth device..Where the apps icon was on the home screen, is now the camera icon. If you're upgrading like I did, you have to flick upwards to get to the apps.

That saying, I absolutely love this phone. I recently switched to the Galaxy S9+ from the ZTE Axon 7 because of the limitations on that phone. The Axon 7 is a really good phone, and although it is an android, there are a lot of differences between that phone and Samsung Androids...The Galaxy S9+ has a great battery life, I charge it using the wireless fast charger in the morning before work and it will last all day through a 10 hour shift plus the gym. I like all the security features like the fingerprint scanner and face detection. It also has great memory and runs easily. I can do multiple things at a time and have multiple windows open and it's not a problem. The sound is also really good, I don't have to turn it up as loud to get the same quality music as with my old phone and the display for the screen is awesome. I take pictures and they look like they are in hd. By far one of my favorite features is the edge panel where you can put frequently used apps and contacts and such. I use that all the time...So far I have no complaints. I've been using this phone for about a month and I'm in love with it. Also buying it through Amazon using their store card and 24 month financing was a plus. That's the only way I could afford such a high price phone...I would definitely recommend this phone to someone else. I never rate anything 5 stars, but as of now the Galaxy S9+ is worth it.",0

5,Top cellphone in the marketplace,08-Apr-18,Yes,"After doing research on pros/cons of top 4 popular smartphones in the marketplace (including iPhone X, Sony XZ2, Huawei Mate 10 Pro, and S9+), i finally made the purchase decision and ordered S9+. I am satisfied with the phone. It provides several super powerful features to improve experience of daily usage..Only one improvement which Samsung could make is to seal product boxes to protect customer's experience of unboxing.",2

3,Flawed software - Wait for an update ... !,06-Apr-18,Yes,"After years of not using Samsung's top-of-the-food-chain devices, I finally gave it a shot with the S9 Plus. Unfortunately, I had to return the device next day...THE GOOD:..Samsung still has excellent built quality and clever features that make their devices unique. I especially fell in love with the DeX feature. Being able to turn your phone into a fully functioning desktop computer is just cool and amazing. I first got introduced to this kind of feature on a Huawei Mate 10 Pro (which I also had to return for other reasons). Once I actually got exposed to the DeX, I knew I wanted it in my life...Samsung's displays are just amazing and unrivaled! I doubt I have to say more. :)..The camera was ok. For some reason, it didn't live up to the hype; at least not in my opinion. Compared to my Pixel 2 XL pictures, the ones taken with the Samsung were way too bright, sometimes over exposed, looked rather soft and lacked depth / details. In this days and age, that's nitpicking, I know. All top tier phones take great pictures. It doesn't matter which phone you get, every single one of them will take great pictures while letting you down in one or another department...THE ""DOESN'T MATTER MUCH BUT STILL ANNOYING"":..Samsung's launcher (user interface) has improved a lot. I still don't really care for it but I could at least have lived with it. I hate how all the settings have been moved around and how you have to search for them in spots where you would never have expected them. For instance WiFi Calling. Why is that in the settings of the phone app rather than under Network and Connectivity?..Pre-installed apps are just as annoying today as they were a few years back. Granted, this days, it isn't as much as it used to be but why not making them uninstallable rather than baking them into the OS? I know I can disable an app, however, I would prefer if it isn't there in the first place!..Samsung's need to duplicate virtually all and any of Google's services is, in my opinion, a waste of resources and it doesn't make their platform more attractive. Why do I need a Samsung Clock app that doesn't do any more than the default Android Clock app? Why do I need a Samsung Phone app where the default Android Phone app is just fine? Same goes for Samsung Mail, Samsung Calendar and a bunch more. If I could at least remove them and replace them with the stock Android apps, I would be more inclined to buy a Samsung phone...Bixby is a whole other story! From the get-go, I had no intention of using Samsung's assistant. Yet, here she was, right in my face. I could deactivate her on the home screen, however, there was no way of deactivating the assistant entirely. I remembered that the Bixby button (which I hit multiple times already by accident) could be deactivated. Yeah, sure! You first have to create a Samsung account, then configure Bixby just to be able to finally click on a settings icon in Bixby and deactivate the hardware button. I don't know who thought of this nonsense!..As mentioned, I would have been able to live with the above. Annoying (to me), yes, but I could live with it...THE BAD:..The most important thing on the phone simply doesn't work right: network reception! I got 1 to 0 bars of mobile reception where every other phone in the house got at least 3. I constantly lost network. Researching this problem online, I learnt that this has been an issue with all of Samsung's high end devices since the Oreo update. The forums across the globe are filled with user complaints. The German Samsung forum, for example, has 59 pages of users complaining about network reception issues on the S8, S8+, Note 8, S9 and S9+. This has been going on since February, it seems. Users state that their phones were fine with Android 7.x but since the Oreo update, everything is a mess...Strangely, this also affects WiFi calling, too. I wasn't able to place a single call without either fading out conversations or mute calls. There are a gazillion sites out there claiming to have the fix for this issues but none of them actually work. Samsung has yet to acknowledge the problem. Instead, they blame your network provider and make you hard reset your device. If that doesn't help, they will offer you to exchange your brand new device with a refurbished one under warranty - at least that's what they offered me! In between, Samsung issued an update to improve network stability but, looking around in the web, that didn't seem to have solved the problem...Regardless, a phone that can't even do the basic task of being a phone is useless to me, so, I returned mine.",22

Try to answer phone calls and you have to back out of all other screens and if you try to close all screens it shuts off the phone call. S9+ just plain sucks",1

You can customize it it's got so many features..It even gives you hints while using it..The phone is just awesome. And for those who are concerned about app security all you have to do is modify the apps settings. you can controll the apps access to your content and your contacts also.when I think about the price compared to an iPhone x.Its so much more reasonably priced.This phone is way ahead of iPhone.I usually dont write reviews but this phone deserves my review.Try it, you will be amazed.It's an awesome phone.this phone is way ahead apple has a lot of work to do.Wish I could buy this phone for everyone I know.On a scale of 1 through 5.This phone deserves a 7 stars",0

1,DON'T BUY. Useless battery. Stay away!!!!!!,27-Jun-18,Yes,"DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!! Samsung S9 has a useless battery. I can literally see the battery life decreasing right before my eyes. It doesn't last a full 8-5 normal use. That's without any use of videos and Spotify. The phone is fast, amazingly fast. But not worth the money. Def, not worth it..A phone must be able to go through a day without running out of battery. And that's cos I disabled important features, like face and iris recognition..Terrible. If I were you, i'd stay away from it.",5
,,,,,
5,Worth every cent!,24-Mar-18,Yes,"I absolutely love my new phone. Samsung hit it out of the park with the S9+. It has every feature, detail, options, and specifics that you could possibly want. When considering whether to purchase this phone, I researched all of the other top rated phones. I truly feel this is the best phone available at this time. Yes, the downfall may be the price. But, I truly believe in the saying, ""You get what you pay for."" The price I paid through Amazon was AT LEAST $50-100 US dollars cheaper than anywhere else. The wrap around full-screen is phenomenal. The camera capability is so good that I don't need to take a separate camera with me any longer. If you have the money, GET IT!!!",14

1,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON USING ABROAD,04-Jul-18,Yes,"I got this phone last month to replace my old iPhone, as I was tired of Apple for a variety of reasons. I was impressed with the picture quality and, reading the reviews, I convinced myself to switch to the Gallaxy S9. When I first received it, I loved it - and this would be a very different review if I wrote it then. But I live in Europe and soon the problems started to show. No Samsung Pay - at all. I checked everywhere and no one has an answer on how to fix that. Then the camera started freezing. It wouldn't go from selfie to portrait nor from camera to gallery without needing a restart. I now just left Samsung's flagship shop in London to find out what to do. Turns out my ONLY choice is to send it back to America and hope for the best. So if you live abroad, know certain features on your phone just will not work and if you ever need assistance, you flat out won't get it.",4

I've been a loyal Samsung customer for years, and when I hold a phone for long term use I really keep it until something is worth purchasing. Where the iPhone lacks the S9 Plus makes up for. The Ram, expandable storage option of 400 GB's, and beautiful display, &amp; somewhat ok price(the more advance the more expensive technology will be) places the phone already ahead of many phone companies. Samsung truly improved upon the phone, and I can say I'm satisfied.",20

Would definitely recommend to someone looking for an upgrade, especially if they don't want to pay more for similar performance on something like, say, the iPhone X. I almost bought an iPhone, and after looking at them both I decided to go with the S9 and I am glad I did. The display is pretty awesome, nice colors, and the storage capacity is great, as well as the added benefit of adding an sd card for extra memory. The speed of the phone is high, even if you have a lot of apps open, probably due to the 4 gb ram. Superb performance overall. Impressed me for sure.",4

Occasionally I trigger the edges when I use it in landscape mode but that's not too big of a deal. I wish it was less of a headache to disable bixby. Even though I have an app that controls bixby, I still see bixby being triggered slightly before the new intended shortcut is triggered. If you're going to use a work profile on here, be warned that depending on your place of work you will not be able to use custom keyboards (understandably so). It's just a bit confusing when my s7 allowed the use of custom keyboards and the s9+ will not (both phones were used for the same job, don't know why the standards are different). Great phone, I'm glad I bought it and am having a better experience with it than the phones I've owned previously (Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy s7, Nexus 7, Pixel XL, Moto X).",1

4,Slick Performance &amp; Exterior,29-Mar-18,Yes,"I'm upgrading from a bricked Nexus 5X so the performance and feel of this phone is leaps and bounds beyond what I'm used to.  I've been using Google phones for a number of years so I was concerned about Samsung wrecking the UI.  But after disabling Bixby and its button, it's pretty much back to working like vanilla Android as far as I'm concerned...I like the ""infinity screen"" for the fact that it increases screen size without greatly increasing the size of the phone.  My 5X is only a bit smaller than the S9+!..My biggest complaint, and the reason I'm giving 4/5 stars is for the exterior feel of this phone - it's very very slippery!  The 5X has a rubberized coating that makes it easy to pick up and hold and also not slide off of surfaces, I greatly miss that.  For example when I navigate while driving I put the phone on my right knee.  This new phone immediately slides right off.  I'm definitely going to get some kind of case or grippy skin for it...I am using this phone on a Red Pocket plan with Verizon service.",3
,,,,,
4,Compared to my last phone it's a dream come true,20-Mar-18,Yes,"Like the title says... I was using an iPhone 5c which was incredibly slow thanks to apple purposefully making it damn near impossible to use after the last and final update they sent me about a year ago.  I'll break down what I like and do not like about this phone though:.Pros - slim, shiny, beautiful screen, fast response times from everything to opening the phone to the apps I use as well as the internet.  If has built in facial and iris recognition and allows you have the alternative option of putting a code or password into the phone to open it.  (Honestly I highly recommend choosing a backup option to unlock the phone because although the facial and iris recognition is great, it's not flawless especially if you're wearing a costume, heavy makeup, etc.) The sound is great and the quality of the photos is amazing compared to what I had before...Cons: the phone is much heavier than what I am used to or what I had expected.  The camera, although great when you're far away, has absolutely awful quality (much worse than my old iPhone) when you zoom in.  The price for the phone was about average.  I found this to be a better deal than the Google XL 2, or the iPhone X which in my opinion were both overpriced, however I still think 760 with taxes is a little much for a phone, especially one that didn't introduce anything new to the market that wasn't already out there and available with other products and companies.  Lastly, if you are an iOS user and are considering switching to android like I did, heed my warning, because I can't put this in larger letters if I tried: DO NOT FORGET TO DEACTIVATE YOUR IMESSAGES.  if you do not deactivate them, you will NOT be able to receive imessages (texts) from ANY iPhone or iPad user.  I ran into a huge issue with this and even though I was incredibly careful, I STILL had to visit the apple webpage to manually deactivate my apple account in order to fix the issue...All in all, I am very happy with my purchase...P.S.: note that if you are changing from iOS to android, you may also run into a problem transferring apps and logging back into any cross phone / platform games that you were playing.  I had to find work around and contact account recovery due to apple using game center vs. Android using Google and Facebook.  I highly suggest you link any games you can't live without to Facebook or gmail prior to switching devices or you will find yourself switching back and forth between devices several times to resolve the issue.",13

1,Not for prime time yet! Needs improvement for accessability badly!,18-Jun-18,Yes,"I received this phone and out of the box, I felt it would be a hard phone to keep a hold of if your hands are damp. I also had some issues within the on screen keyboard. I did like the fact that you could tel the phone to play a notification tone while on a call. I also like the fact you could turn off the call connected/disconnected tones...The phone also has some other things I just can't live with. The phone would play a notification tone whenever I would connect an Bluetooth keyboard and or a hard wired keyboard to it. I couldn't find a way to turn that off. I contacted Samsung and they told me that is just the way the phone works and there wasn't a way to turn that off. US customer service from Samsung in my thoughts is lacking at best...I also got the Notification tones when I turned on/off the Voice Assistant for blind people to use the phone. Thhen on top of that, when using the voice assistant, I couldn't get the caller ID to repete it would only say it once and that was it. I tried quite a few caller ID programs and none of them worked when using a Bluetooth headset to get the caller ID to speak every 5 seconds or so. Without a headset connected by Bluetooth, they worked...The finger commands for there voice assistant for the most part don't work while on a call. Example: if I'm not on a call with voice assistant running, I could triple tap with two fingers and get status information like for time, network, WiFi etc... While on a call it says nothing. Same way with a lot of the other commands they don't work...To me for a blind person, I would stay away from this phone as the way it currently is.",6

3,Not a gift from heaven,27-Apr-18,Yes,"Phone arrived on time a and in good condition.It might be somewhat louder than the 8plus, but not much. The phone itself appears to simply be an s7 with two speakers. The glowing reviews of the camera might be accurate but my purchase wasn't guided by taking selfies. The camera is secondary to me. An overall great phone but doesn't live up to the hype.",4

5,Very nice evolution of the S8,16-Mar-18,No,"On the fence here whether I think it should get 4 stars or 5 - probably 4.6 or thereabouts, if we're counting. I purchased mine direct from Samsung, it arrived on March 14th as promised. I'm upgrading from an S8, and have previously owned an S7 and Note 5. This is the best of the bunch, for certain, and there is little or no learning curve going from one to the other. They took a really good smartphone (S8), and just made it better in many ways (and, in my opinion, worse in a couple, but more on that later). Dimensions - it's extremely similar to the S8, the only noticeable difference is the overall length is a touch shorter - compensated for by having less black margin around the screen edges.Visually, the screen is fantastic. The touch responsiveness is fantastic, and the performance is snappy. The fingerprint scanner is in a far better position than on the S8...Things I don't like as much - the iris scanning/facial recognition. I preferred the system in the S8 for sure. The avatars of yourself you can make from a selfie are, well, just downright creepy.",24

1,Dont buy from Samsung directly.,26-May-18,No,"I bought the S9 directly from Samsung.com, and wow was that a huge mistake. I got the phone, switched over my service with Verizon and sent the old phone off for credit. The next day I noticed the S9 had some minor physical damage from shipping. I was going to let it slide but thought, nah, I just bought this thing, its on them to fix it...Samsung refuses to do anything but a refund for sending back the phone. I cant be without a phone, my business depends on me talking to clients. I asked them to send me a new one and ill return the defective one once i switch my service over. They refuse... I'm blown away. Had I bought the phone from Amazon, Best Buy or, hell, even Verizon, they would have given me that option. I tried talking to managers, I tried using chat, email, nothing works...The phone itself inst bad, but Samsung customer service is disgusting. This is coming from a guy who has their 75"" QLED TV, Family Hub Smart Fridge, touchscreen washer and dryer, and literally everything else Samsung offers...You lost a customer for life, and i loved you guys. What a sad way to go.",18

I was hesitant at first because it doesn't have a home button but I have completely forgot about it already. The touch sensor is lightning fast compared to the s7 and the iris/face scanner is bad either. The one biggest complaint I have is the bixby button which they don't let you remap.,12

2,I loved my Galaxy s5,25-Apr-18,Yes,"In Mobile Networks, under APN, it says Tracfone reseller!  For this price, I did not want a reburbished phone. Not only thiat, but the MMS messages do not come through and I can't for the life of me,  find out how to write a message...I'm sure that's something I've overlooked though...All in all, I loved my Galaxy s5.  If I could find a way of charging the battery, I'd continue using it, but the prongs are all screwed up...Don't get me wrong, I guess this is a beautiful phone and all for techies, but It doesn't do what my old phone did. I wish I could find a NEW galaxy s5. but i'm sure they're all refurbished too.  I'm just really disappointed. A lot of the features just don'[t work on my phone...Not worth almost a 1000.

1,"Terrible, poorly designed phone",30-Apr-18,Yes,"I wound up returning this phone. I HATED it. In no way did it justify it's cost. The Huawei Mate SE is much, much better. Granted, the screen quality isn't quite as good, nor is the camera. However, the software is better thought out and implemented and, as such, much more user oriented and modifiable. I used the S9+ for about a week and went back to the Mate SE. I was much, much happier until (lo and behold) I received an S9+ as a gift. Now I use the S9+ just so I won't hurt someone's feelings. Karma better remember this..BTW, who was the idiot that placed the fingerprint sensor right underneath the camera lenses? You always wind up smudging them when you scan your print..The S9+ is one poorly designed phone..UPDATE : The hell with karma. I went back to the Huawei Mate SE. I can be nice for only so long.",12
,,,,,
5,Iphone x Has Nothing on This,14-Apr-18,No,"I had an iphone X but I sold it for this. The iphone x was a huge disappointment. I used to buy nothing but apple products, but I realized how far behind apple is. This phone has a much larger display and higher quality than the x. Plus there is no annoying top notch at the top. The camera is better, I took pictures on both phones and the samsung was the only phone to pick up the fine print from a picture on my wall standing 12 ft away. The iphone x was blurry and the print wasn't legible. This phone has an incredible aperture to take crisp pictures even in low light. I don't believe its oversaturated, it all depends on what area of the screen you tap on and the phone will adjust the colors accordingly. Overall this phone probably has one of the best cameras on the market...The specs are good, you'll be able to multitask without any issues...The battery life is about average for me, it's not as much as I would like but it's not terrible either. I use my phone a lot for business, emails, video etc.. it gets me through the majority of my working hours around 7 hours of on screen time...Coming from an iphone user this is much better!",4
,,,,,
1,Do not buy if using T-Mobile,18-Jun-18,No,"Do NOT buy an S9 if you use T-Mo and plan to go overseas. Samsung has a very bad pop-up message that wants you to switch out of roaming, but you need to be in roaming when traveling with T-Mo. The pop-up can't be disabled and opens about 50 times a day. This has been a known issue since November 2017 and Samsung hasn't done anything about it.",5

5,Now Galaxy S9+ is truly the flagship smartphone that has it all done properly,09-May-18,No,"iPhone user and totally converted after trying S9+. Bought EU model with Equinios processor, 256 GB internal memory and 400 GB SD card. I need it for shooting video and 656 GB of available memory I have finally no problem..Camera is to die for, love colors and depth, comparable to iPhone X, so iPhone lost its prevous advantage..Display is the best currently available on any smartphone. Samsung definitely leads the game here..Sounds is stereo with Dolby, what makes it way more pleasant than iPhoneX currently..In terms of speed, it is maybe because of software, I do not play games, but for everything else I feel that Galaxy S9+ is faster than iPhone. 6 GB RAM makes lot of sense, as well..It really feels like fast computer and going back to anything slower is painful..Fast charging and wireless fast charging are added bonuses, it takes few short hours and works perfect..At current price for global market models (2 SIM cards, faster processor, 256 GB memory) and I paid 930 $, it is way better proposition than iPhone X. It is much cheaper to pay 100% for the phone and pick some smarter plan than to buy on monthly plan. Do the math..Bottom line, as convert from Apple, I may witness that Galaxy is truly an achievement, design, quality, functionality and reliability. It is all there now.",2

5,is still 'acting' like the same phone 6-months or a year from now ...,10-May-18,No,"I am thrilled so far...I have had this phone for only a week, so time will tell what longevity will hold for me...I can honestly say that if the phone I own now, is still 'acting' like the same phone 6-months or a year from now (in regards to not developing glitches/issues), that it will be the best phone I have ever owned...I have never and will never own an Iphone, and I have never been a samsung anything guy in the past either. I have never liked samsung electronics (always found them 'cheaper' than competitor products). My first samsung phone 20 years ago (flip phone) was complete rubbish. My Son's Galaxy 5 (or 6?) was a nightmare. THIS PHONE however, has won me over...- Reception - best..- App speed - best..- Battery - very good..- Glitchiness - none..- Voice quality - very good..- Visuals - outstanding...The ONLY thing NOT superior on this phone vs my last is sound. I have had HTC flagship phones in  the past couple of years and they are way ahead of their time with speaker/voice/sound quality. The bar was set very high with the HTC and I never expected the Galaxy to match it, nevermind beat it, BUT the Galaxy makes a valiant effort. I will miss that sound with my old phone, but if that is the only thing I have to sacrifice for an otherwise far superior phone, I can live with that...Only other concern I have is that the responsiveness to the screen, with or without a screen protector sometimes has me thinking it is not capturing my finger taps and swipes, but it is very minor (for now). I have read reviews where this has become a major issue for some so i will need to keep an eye out for that...I will post back after some time of using this phone to inform if it is still holding up to this gleaming review...I am on T-mobile with this phone as a point of reference...Lastly, I really wanted to buy an unbranded phone here from Amazon, but I had to buy from T-mobile because I have read that you cannot utilize the wifi calling feature with unbranded phones. While this is not a HUGE deal for me, it is a feature that while I don't use often, it would be a nice feature to have if I need it. That said, my biggest reason for wanting to buy an unbranded phone is to avoid bloatware, but honestly, this phone isn't too bad in that respect. Not that i have noticed thus far anyway.",1

4,Nice phone/camera but it is a super slippery fragile fingerprint ...,18-Apr-18,No,"Nice phone/camera but it is a super slippery fragile fingerprint magnet.  Case was late from Amazon, slipped out of my pocket18 inches off ground and the screen cracked.  Weak.  I like my Note 4 better.  Bit of buyer's remorse for me.",4
,,,,,
5,Almost flawless,06-Jun-18,No,"First let me say that most of the negative reviews I have read about this phone are from people complaining about samsung bloatware, too many notifications, or bixby. The people who are complaining about this dont know how to use the phone. First of all you can disable a lot of bloatware apps and for the ones that you cannot disable, you are able to hide those apps. For notifications, you can disable notifications for any apps that you choose. As for bixby, you can disable the bixby button as well as turn off bixby home if you dont like it. I honestly forgot that bixby was on this phone...Now that I've gotten that out of the way, over all this phone is amazing and truly premium. Touchwiz is fluid and intuitive. The fingerprint sensor has been moved to an ideal location, the speakers sound really cool with Dolby atmos. It's TRUE surround sound especially when you watch a video in landscape mode, the sound is really cool. The intelligent scan has worked great for me but I dont use it that much. I've had this phone for about 2 months now and it's still extremely fast and snappy. The overall interface is beautiful...My only negatives about this phone are in regards to the camera because I wish it had a dual lens rear camera like the s9+. Not sure why samsung didnt make this phone with the dual lenses. The camera is still good, but this would have been cool to have. My other complaint is the camera interface is a little bit odd and takes some getting used to...Overall it's a truly premium phone. Best android experience you can get in my opinion. Samsung packs so many features into their phones and I love it. Some people complain about this but I love exploring these features.",2
,,,,,
5,Best Phone Available!!!,10-Jun-18,No,"This is a fantastic phone.  Awesome screen, and the camera is good enough that you don't need to purchase a separate camera to take pictures.  well thought out and very fast.  We purchased the 256GB version directly from samsung.  It also has a microSD card slot, so you can add another 400GB on top of the 256GB internal...The wireless charging is also great.  it works even when there is a leather case on the phone.  not sure how it works, but it's pretty cool.",2
,,,,,
4,A very powerful and advanced phone....but not perfect....,20-May-18,No,"This is a great phone with a lot of cool features and a top-notch camera, but I could do without Bixby and the overwhelming number of useless apps on it.  In addition, price-wise, it is not exponentially better (10X) than the BlackBerry Z10 that I switched over from and suffers from the following issues that take it down a notch:..-Google Play doesn't download the album art if you transfer music over from your computer. It's not the end of the world, but the Z10 wasn't missing any album covers in its library.  I downloaded a pay-for-play music player and pushed Google Play to the next page because I wanted whatever album art I could get.  Without it, I find it kind of bland..-I am astounded as to why e-mails, phone calls and texts are all in different places. The S9+ should have a hub ""stream"", similar to the Z10.  I found that I needed to download the BlackBerry Hub for Android feature because it provides the user with one stream of e-mails, phone calls and text messages.  BlackBerry Hub for Android is the best thing since sliced bread and it is available either free (without ads for 30 days and with ads after that), and 99 cents a month (without ads), thereafter. From the human factors perspective, this is something that Samsung should be offering, especially at its advanced rate of development..-When a calendar event opens, there's no option to ""snooze""..-Playing music with earbuds was a little disappointing. The BlackBerry Z10 had a built-in optional booster and the sound quality was much better with richer bass, even with a $10 pair of earbuds.  The S9+ DOES have very good speaker sound, though...I bought this phone because I thought it was time to upgrade to an Android-based device that could run more apps, especially from the proprietary BlackBerry O/S that is going or gone extinct.  The S9+ is a very nice phone, but it is a little lacking and not flawless.  I am one that will probably not use it to play Pokemon or for any gaming.  The core features I use it for are phone, e-mail, music and some Android apps.  It's nice having a phone that can do the latter, but it would also be nice to have the best of both worlds.",0
,,,,,
4,An S8 but better,04-Jul-18,No,"If you've already used or owned an S8, the S9 is going to be a very familiar device.  Same-fish design, same glorious Samoled display, same 18.5:9 aspect ratio, etc. Dont expect a drastic change from the S8 going to this phone...However, there are improvements such as a dual aperture camera, which isn't an apparent change at first until you dive into pro mode, a stereo speaker setup with the earpiece finally playing media when watching videos or playing games, and a better fingerprint sensor location. The bottom chin of the phone is also a bit smaller than it is on the S8 so there's a little asymmetricism going on when you rotate the phone sideways but hey, no dumb notch right? Samsung's skin is still drastically different from Google's vision of Android but serious work done with the s8 to improve performance is still present and I actually prefer the aesthetics of Samsung Experience, the new name of the software skin compared to stock vanilla android Oreo...Only downsides I can see are still average battery life and the general use of gorilla glass 5, which is more shatter resistant but quite a bit easier to scratch. There's two or three microscratches along the front glass though it's just the oleophobic coating and it's nowhere near the sensors, not to mention it's hard to see. That might just be me though as I'm rockin' the phone naked. Curved glass is also pretty much just for aesthetics and having an option to not have them or at least just have small curved edges would be more preferable but not a big issue for me...Either way, the S9 is a definite option to consider if you're planning to upgrade to a new phone anytime soon...EDIT: added more photos",1

5,Let go off Apple with no looking back.,29-Jun-18,No,"I've worked in the wireless industry since the very beginning of iPhone &amp; Android. I've been hands on with every smartphone from the HTC EVO 4G (one of the first 'big' screen phones sitting at a whopping 4.3in), Samsung Galaxy Fascinate (the first Galaxy phone of it's kind) Blackberry Curve, Bold, Torch and of course, iPhone. The first smartphone I owned was the Blackberry Curve following the discontinuation of the trackball (on the curve, the Bold still had it). From the Blackberry, I switched back and forth between Apple and Android for years, but always ended up sticking with Apple simply because the OS was more stable, the screen's response time was less laggy and as we all know, more accessories...Well last week, I had the iPhone 7 and for the past couple of months became more and more disappointed with apps force closing, losing service (more of a Sprint issue), alarms not going off, videos not loading when I did have serivce, battery dying by the middle of the day after a full night's charge, I was done. Looking at my options, the iPhone 8 seems like the poor man's iPhone X or for those who did not have the 7. The iPhone X itself is just WAY too expensive for me to sign for. Then we have the latest flagship Android devices, the Samsung s9 and the Google Pixel 2...Now to be honest, if I decided to switch to Verizon instead of At&amp;t;, I probably would have gone with the Pixel 2 (exclusive to verizon) but I've always preferred At&amp;t.; I decided to bite the bullet one more time and strp away from Apple, so I went with the s9. Now keep in mind, I use a s7 for work and I absolutely hate that phone, so that alone had me second guessing my decision. The main reason I did it was due to the price difference. Until I have no choice, I'll never spend over 4 digits on a phone...For the first time ever, I can confidently say that I will never go back to an iPhone, Samsung finally got it right. This phone has succeeded every expectation I had. The most important enhancement from previous models is the screen's response time, without a doubt. The ease of using the keyboard on an iPhone vs Android has always been a winning factor to me, but that is no longer the case. The touchscreen I'd so fluit, the processor is rapid fast and does not hesitate for a second while bouncing between applications, the camera is AMAZING and even has it's own version of Apple's portrait mode, except Samsung gives you the ability to adjust focus even after the picture has been taken. Up to 400gb expandable storage on a phone that's $300 cheaper than it's competition, are you kidding me??..I also preferred the iPhone due to it's simplicity and over-the-top customization never appealed to me. But wow, has Samsung come a long way since I last played with their themes. It's so much cleaner and user friendly. After convincing myself I'd probably just keep the phone stock, I ended up pulling an all-nighter going through all the personalization options until I finally designed me phone to feel 100% unique for me. Best of all, aside from the addition of Google Keyboard, I did not use any 3rd party apps, everything was done through Samsung Themes which keeps it just as stable as the stock version of the phone. Oh and the screen itself? Absolutely beautiful. 4k video and images are breathtaking and the curve has finally been perfected. Battery life? After 10 hours, I'm 79% as of this very minute. Fast charging could put me back up to 100% easily within 15-20 minutes...If Samsung continues improving from the s9, I will never switch back to any other phone. Even if they end up blowing it down the road, I'll be looking towards the Google Pixel (unlocked in my case) either way, no more Apple. It's simply not worth it compared to the quality available elsewhere and Samsung has finally proven that to me.",1

1,Touchscreen nav bar died,24-May-18,No,"I was very happy at first with my purchase, as this is a very powerful phone..But, seems that there's a growing issue in which areas of the screen die and get unresponsive..In my case it was the Navigation Bar, but other people in forums have this same issue in different areas of the touchscreen too.",4

4,Amazing with some shortcomings.,08-May-18,No,So my review of this phone may be a bit different than others I have never heard of anyone else having the complaints I have with the most recent of the Samsung line up. With that said I will start with what I do like the S9 has the best camera I have ever used that is the single thing keeping me on Samsung currently. I also love everything software wise besides Bixby I always hit it by accident coming from the Lg G6 I am used to volume down being there. But here's my issue with it the screen curve away from the viewer annoys the crap out of me if i prop my phone up with its stand to watch videos the curved part usually gets a glare and it makes the phone far less easy to protect with the screen being way more open to contact on dropping it. I have decided when LG makes a new phone like the G7 maybe I will go back because I really enjoyed the flatter screens and the Lg setup was more appealing (No Bixby) but I will miss this amazing camera if LG slips up in that department.,0

3,Returned after a week because of Macbook Integration,18-Apr-18,Yes,"I decided to move to Android after 5+ years with Apple. Main reason I bought the s9+ was the camera..You can get along with the Android way of doing things, but what really pissed me of was when I tried to backup the photos I took in my Macbook...Actually I have *returned* this phone after struggling an entire day searching an easy way to backup pictures on my Mac...After trying 5 different apps (including some weirdo chinese apps), trying with an SD card and everything, it was clear to me that this phone integration with a Macbook was a big NO for me. Oh, did I mention that some of the files got corrupted when I moved from internal storage to Micro SD?",1
,,,,,
3,The phone is good but not a great,16-May-18,No,"The phone is good but not a great. First the curved screen is annoying if you use the phone without a case because touching these edges by mistake will block the other parts inputs plus the edges are more light reflective than the middle part so watching a movie on the gym or bright place is annoying. The second problem is that, we are in 2018 and I still don't get it why Samsung still hasn't added the "" Screen turns on by notification"" feature yet when 99% of the phones today have this feature. Lastly, the power save on the phone is still bad, If someone is new to Samsung will not know he or she needs to turn off the battery saving mode on some apps such as Gmail and Yahoo mail, or their E-mails will be arrived late.",0

1,Product is NOT new. It comes used and disorganized,13-Apr-18,Yes,"I received it on April 11 2018 and sadly it was used.

5,Would recommend getting the S9.... S9 Plus if you're a camera buff,18-Apr-18,No,"Literally the best phone I've ever had, I loved it so much I decided to upgrade to the S9 Plus version. Here's my layman's review on both...PROs:.- The night photos are where this phone shines, definitely able to get every detail possible in low lighting..- Battery life is massive with both phone: S9 has a 3000mAh / S9 Plus 3500mAh.- Plenty of RAM: S9 has 4gigs/ S9 Plus 6gigs. Both perform very extremely well but 6 gigs worth of RAM seems like overkill as 4 gigs from the S9 suffice with little to no slowdowns..-  Headphone jack on both version. Also comes with some sweet AKG earbuds..- AR emoji is relatively fun and great to show to people interested in checking out the phone.- Thin phone.- 4k Video quality.- Great Speakers.- Samsung Pay, literally can be used anywhere that accepts Cards as it mimics the magnetic strip (Not like Google Pay that relies on the ereader)..- Live Translations with Bixby Vision.- (Plus Version)  Live photo mode. Really great feature, and editable.-  (Plus version) 2 Rear Cameras with optical zoom at 2x and digital at 10x, and dual capture..CONs:.- While night photos are amazing, daytime photos can sometimes appear overly saturated..- There isn't a noticeable size difference between both phones..- What is the point of Bixby? Really difficult to incorporate it into my daily life without actively thinking ""I should give Bixby a try"".- While thin, it's somewhat heavy..- Besides the camera, there isn't a massive difference between S9 and S9 Plus...VERDICT:.As stated above, I love the S9 so much I upgraded to the Plus version. Both phones run extremely fast with little to no slowdown, even having several apps open does little to bog it's performance down. Photos look fantastic at especially at night with both versions. My only issue is the new Bixby button: it's not something I would actively use but at least users can disable this feature. Overall it's a lovely phone, S9 works just as well as the S9 Plus but lacking a few features with the camera.",2
,,,,,
2,Not everyone is a fanboy,25-Jun-18,No,"Clearly I am not a Samsung fanboy. I purchased an S6 that I was unhappy with. The amount of ""bloatware"" and ""pushed"" software was incredible. The phone's performance was at best lackluster. I traded it in after a few months. Then the S9 came out with much fanfare and reviews that often put ahead of anything else. It's as bad or worse than the S6. Yes performance is way ahead, but the ""bloatware"" and ""pushed"" software is worse than ever.The touch screen seems ultra sensitive at the edge, but try touching in the middle. It's hit or miss, even with the sensitivity set to believe I have a screen protector which I don't. Opening the screen sometimes reveals the home page, sometimes it is some other random thing from an app. Then there's ""butt dials"" that I'm not sure are truly butt dials as I have had more in 3 months than I have had in in total over the last 3 years! While on that subject, I an be walking around with my phone in my pocket and it suddenly starts playing music. The local Verizon store has attempted to resolve many of these issues without success. They have offered to replace the phone, but the one that they sent me was ""refurbished"" and had many scratches on the screen-light but still scratches. I refused it. All this makes me wonder how the reviews could be so positive. Farewell Samsung.",2

5,samsung best phone,19-Apr-18,No,this is a great phone with excellent battery life.great for people who are power users.very fast i upgraded from a galaxy s7 edge to the galaxy s9 plus coral blue.the s9 plus has edge screen and if you turn your phone over during a sound or notification it will stop the sound..the speakers are very  loud once you turn on dolby atmos.the cameras are wonderful..this is a must buy.,1

3,"Nice phone, overly complicated camera...",16-May-18,No,"The Galaxy S9 is a great looking and working phone, but I challenge you to try to figure out all the camera features they show in the commercial...They show all sorts of things like 'swing' and 'boomerang'  and 'super slo-mo', but the only feature I can actually find is the slo-mo.  The other features are buried somewhere in the camera and Samsung provides ZERO instructions on how to use them...I'm currently scouring the internet to see how to activate these features, but it is a major fail for Samsung for not providing guidance in the box.",0

I've never experienced this much lagging in any of my old Samsung's phones (S3, S6, S7, S8)  but got damn this one does it a lot. I clear my ram often and restart my phone almost every 3 days.

Bixby is the worst, you need an app to block this useless crap. All in all good phone if Samsung would just listen to customers.",4

5,Superb!,07-Apr-18,No,"I've been a fan of the Galaxy series, both tablets and phones, having extensive experience with the S5, S6, S8 and now the S9+. The S9+ has dual rear-facing cameras, a first in the series. This feature alone was worth upgrading as I'm an avid amateur photographer with several nice DSLR cameras, but face it, I take far more photos with my phone simply because it's always with me...Transitioning from the S8 to S9+ took an hour but was smooth as silk.  *Everything* transferred automatically - apps, pics, files, settings - including the kitchen sink. Lol..I highly recommend - 5 golden stars!",2

1,The screen is not resistant at all,03-Jul-18,No,"The phone was great since i had upgraded from the s7 but the screen seems to be very fragile in my case the phone screen cracked while being in my pocket and protected by tempered glass and a phone case after this i called my insurance and they sent me back a new phone for a deductible of $200 the new phone broke in the same way as the first one in less than a week although this one was not protected by tempered glass after seeing booth had broken in less then a month i contacted samsung customer support something I would never do again since all they did was waste my time I was told I had to send my phone to be inspected and they would repair under warrantty. I sent my phone to them and it arrived at their facility two days later. After 10 days I had not received any information from samsung so I decided to call. When I called I was informed the phone was processing and I would recieve it in 5 buisness days, later that day I finally recieved notification they had my phone processing and it would be ready soon. Now 2 days ago I recieved a bill for repair costs of 247.89 way more than my deductible because my phone was not covered by warranty.",1

5,Easy switch from iPhone!!!,08-Apr-18,No,"While I have had several Samsung devices in the past - I spent the last few years with several different iPhone options.  In addition to the step price and ear buds priced separately, I am much more of a fan of Amazon apps / products and my feeling was these would adapt better to Android products.  I am so thrilled I took the leap to make this change - and here is a list why:..1.  Super high quality phone - with simple set up..2.  AMAZING camera with loads of different features..3.  Dual sim - so enjoy BOTH work and personal number on the same device..4.  DUAL WHATSAPP!!!.5.  Seamless integration for all Amazon apps (photos, shopping, music, Kindle, and Audible).  Same was not true ot iPhone products..6.  I have been duped by Apple to some degree - H have invested thousands in TV and movies through iTunes - hoping that one day they make these available on other devices, but happy that purchases through Google or Amazon will be should I move back to Apple in the future..7.  Can't beat the price - was able to trade in an old phone and saved $200!!..It is hard to say what the future holds but I am quite happy to be back with Samsung for now!!",0

1,Reported problems - Do Not Buy,24-Apr-18,No,"I've had this phone for 16 days and it's now dead. When it worked, it was slower than my iPhone 6 plus. Had trouble with texting that I thought was due to software lag. Seems others are facing similar problems and it's likely a touchscreen problem (dead zones). Samsung already issued a statement that it's working on the issue. My phone is also completely frozen. Even if I reboot, it freezes at the Samsung screen. I asked Samsung to send me a replacement but they refused and referred me to repair facility.  It's currently at the repair shop for the 2nd day. Very expensive inconvenience. Avoid this handset.",5

5,Great all around flagship from Samsung,07-May-18,No,"Honestly this is one of the best smartphones I've used in a long time. Snappy, UI is good, screen is gorgeous, camera is great, pretty much everything to expect when purchasing a 800+ smartphone..The real complaint I have is the speakers sound when cranked to full as on EDM and some hip hop( these are the main genres I listen to) the bass levels drastically drop. A bit dissapointing but cranking it down a little bit and back to business as usual...Anyway its a great phone and I would definitely say it is a contender for one of the best phones of 2017-2018.",0

3,Screen is fragile and NOT covered by warranty.  Beware.,04-May-18,No,"Good - It's a good phone, no doubt about it.  Feels sturdy, something about slow motion, NFC, all the fancy features (you can read the other reviews and marketing jazz)...Bad - Now here is what gets me - this fancy screen is fragile.  Be aware - the SCREEN IS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY.  Even with all kinds of screen protectors, drop this phone and you risk the screen cracking..Yes, friends it happens much easier than it should.  We had the same issue with the S8 and the S9.  It was dropped from a reasonable height (between knee and hip - the exact height you will carry and use it at) and both the S8 and S9 shattered..The worst part is that Samsung refuses to cover the screen under their ""warranty."".The local shop they sent us to did fix the 9 for about $100 less than the S8 (total was $235 for the S9 fix).  Also, remember this phone just came out, we've had it less than two months.  The shop said they already had 20+ people in with broken S9 screens..Wish i could go back to non-curved, more durable devices.",4

1,Ruined good hardware with Terrible Software. Almost Unusable.,13-Jun-18,No,Worst phone I have ever used. Samsung took a fully functional operating system and stripped out all the good features to replace them with Samsung services that require another login. Basic features don't work. I get terrible or no signal in areas where I used to have great signal. I haven't changed carriers or my plan. I'm constantly having buffering issues I never had with my Nexus 5x.

3,Much to lean from a long time iPhone user,19-Apr-18,No,"The screen is beautiful. The ability to customize is overwhelming.  The always on clock is a great idea..The camera takes great pictures, but since the screen is to the edge, I am always accidentally enabling something while holding it..Its harder just to make a quick phone call than the iPhone is (need more customizing I guess)..The slide down feature on the lock screen has many options, but no clock or calculator like the iPhone does (without add-on modifying)..The standard ring tones are very limited and not desirable. Even though the music plays loud, the ringtones do not..Even though it has a press button lock, then swipe, it still seems to unlock in my pocket. But the iPhone did too..The Bixby turns on when I DONT want it to, and doesn't when I do. Very frustrating..The USB C connector is nice..There are 1000 things this phone can do that I have not discovered yet.",2

Right now I'm actually watching hulu and I'm typing this. Which on my iphone I couldn't do. And the way it performs is 100% better than my brand new iPhone x. I was pretty skeptical because I would lose everything from my iphone especially imessages. But honestly I dont miss it at all.

4,The operating system is way way more polished and the camera is superior to my Panasonic Lumix,03-Apr-18,No,"This is my third Samsung Galaxy after switching from the original iPhone.  This was a huge upgrade from my Galaxy Alpha.  The operating system is way way more polished and the camera is superior to my Panasonic Lumix.  My wife's Galaxy S8 seems just about the same but the 9 is noticeably zippier but I have way fewer apps.  In our household we have Macs, PC's, iPads, Roku's, Tablets so we aren't married to any particular brand.  For the phones I've enjoyed Samsungs.  My wife got a deal on an LG and it was a big headache as it had hardware failures...Important, currently, as of this writing the S9 has a software problem where notifications on the apps DOES NOT work.  Since I've come to rely on those little numbers on the top left corner of my apps this is an inconvenience.  My old Samsung came with SVoice which I prefer over Bixby for simplicity but it's slowly winning me over.  Ask Bixby to Rap for you, it's hilarious.",1

5,Not my ideal phone but it is good. Right out the box I had to make ...,06-May-18,No,"Came from a Huawei honor 8. I got this phone as a gift... I was looking to buy a one plus 6t or mate 10 pro when the prices come down... But hey I have an s9+ now... Not my ideal phone but it is good...Right out the box I had to make some adjustments. Deleted a slew of aps or moved them to a folder. Changed the always on display to not, because battery life is a thing I need. Phone case, yeah I got a clear one and a skin, because the downside to a phone like this is everyone has one and I don't want to advertise I have an s9+ for theft reasons. So I got it in purple because black is bi gender and purple is for girls and gays so there is less value in the black market if stolen. Got me a skin and a clear case and a film screen protector, because I don't plan on upgrading till 2020 when you know 98% screen phones will be a thing (like bro I don't need the NSA always looking at me with a front facing camera)...So yeah. I mean the camera is awesome. It is literally why you get an s9+. You get an iPhone x if you are an idiot who is allergic to money and wants to blow $5000 on the app store and when your iPhone breaks you don't believe in repairing so you buy a new one, like that is cool dawg...So yeah the nice thing about having the best phone is repair shops can fix it if it gets busted so yeah...I wish this thing had an IR blaster because jacking control over devices is useful. Like my ac etc. But I have an honor 8 to use as an ac remote  when I can't find it... So that is good. I shouldn't eat at restaurant that play CNN fake news anyway, so annoying, one lady kept turning back on the TV when I kept turning it off. Like wtf yo...So I guess I can live without an IR blaster. I am surprised this thing has a headphone jack and is ip 68 rated for water. Kudos. iPhone x is ip 67, losers.",0

3,"Great phone, but similar phone for much less is out there",18-May-18,No,"Great phone, three stars because I am comparing it to a phone that is less than half the cost with close performance. Look at the ZTE Axon 7 and you will find a lesser camera, but not by much plus stereo speakers and a solid build. I returned it because it is so much more than the ZTE and only offers modest upgrades in comparison. That being said, the phone itself is beautiful and well made with lots of great features, but the price point is the killer based on its mild competition. This is all my opinion for my needs an economic philosophy and I mean no disrespect to Samsung. It's just too much money for what else is out there at this time.",1

2,Not quite up to the hype.,23-Jun-18,No,"Back in March, I switched from an LG V20 to the S9+ because the screen on my LG began to bleed through. Big mistake. The Samsung pales in comparison to the LG. There's no tap or knock to wake option, the fingerprint sensor is finicky, scrolling through social media is a chore and I found myself growing more and more aggravated with daily use. In short, I paid the phone off early. When I was in the store explaining at how dissatisfied I was with the phone, a Samsung representative was present.  Upon overhearing my gripes, he just said something about not pleasing everyone. While that's true and there is no perfect phone, Samsung sure has some catching up to do with LG.  Much better User Interface on LG and the fingerprint sensor isn't as finicky.  Do yourself a favor and check out the V30 or the G7.  Skip the S9+",1

2,... upgraded from the S7 to the S9+ and I'm terribly disappointed. Last week,04-Apr-18,No,"Recently upgraded from the S7 to the S9+ and I'm terribly disappointed. Last week, I decided to upgrade from a Samsung S7 to a Samsung S9+. I even went all in with the BOGO deal from Verizon and upgraded Junior at the same time...Rarely have I been so disappointed in a tech purchase! And Samsung, I hope you have people watching for this sort of post. I'll be RETURNING. THIS. PHONE. tomorrow. Major shortcomings include ""Bixby,"" microphone placement, and voice recognition...First, the ""Bixby"" personal assistant is a train wreck. I don't know who decided that an unholy union of the Yahoo! home page and Google Assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark. And it CAN'T. BE. DISABLED. Nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled...Second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless. Seriously, Samsung?! the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down...Thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal. These features worked nearly flawlessly on my S7, but on the S9+ I'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone ""hears"" when I talk to it. I have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good. Even if I shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, I can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words. I spend 50-60 hours per week driving and MUST be able to communicate hands free as much as technologically possible...Swing and a resounding miss, Samsung.",13

Interface sucks, apps never work correctly, better life is terrible. You have to research a lot to use settings correctly. This is like a box store PC where billions of third party software that do the same thing. There are more than 3 options asked of you to back up your phone and I learned that they did not work. It's bad when their are app developers making apps to work around problems with the phone's native applications and settings. Never buying another android or Samsug anything ever again.",0

1,Screen breaks super easy!!,16-Jul-18,No,Ok so what an amazing phone and yet even with a good case the screen has broken twice. $ 400 to repair. Could have bought something else with that money.  The curb is killing me. Time to leave Samsung until they can make one with a non curbed screen.,0

2,Great if you have it plugged into the wall,15-May-18,No,"This phone surpasses any iPhone currently and previously on the market. I bought it as a second phone just to use for posting pictures for my real estate business. I would take it over IOS any day if it wasn't for the battery Life. You would have more luck using a sidekick from 2005 plugged into a potato to hold a better charge than this phone. The note 7 (which I also owned) blew up and this one just dies after 30 minutes of use. If you can charge it for three hours to use the camera it a great.. other than that you get a ""battery too low to use flash"" message. After missing tens of important business calls and overall not being able to use the device due to its 45 minute battery life i am switching fully back to iPhone.",0

1,Yard sale trash,23-Apr-18,No,This phone is a yard sale...I cannot attach text tones to contacts?..I cannot turn off the camera shutter noise without turning off all system sounds?..I cannot adjust lengths of time text notifications remain on the screen? By the time I have picked up the phone and brought it close enough to read it disappears?..I cannot adjust the timeout length of the lock screen? I go to it to glance at notifications and it turns off...AND THIS IS THE NINTH VERSION?..What an utterly clunky experience.,7

1,Completely broken notifications. Curved glass is a disaster. Excellent display.,17-Mar-18,No,"I am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications..I use LG, Pixel and Iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon Samsung long time ago. Every cheap LG just worked better than Samsung for me..Decided to try S9  due it's small size; the only other option was Google Pixel but its display is just too bad. The only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display. Heck, except in Youtube, the buttons are always  there, making that 5"" screen more like 4.5"", in a body that's wider than S9. What a nonsense....Anyway, S9 notifications:..No notifications on locked screen:  I have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then I'll see notifications. Iphone/Pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, I can see if it's anything interesting, if not I go with my work, the phone turns off the screen...Limited notifications on locked screen:.Shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone. Some settings available that don't help much. Androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications. If you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app...Raise to wakeup and show notifications:.With iphone/Pixel/Nexus, I would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showing  notifications. As soon as I put the phone down the screen goes off. When I pickup S9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure.....Notifications while using the phone:.Some message comes in, the phone does NOTHING. Sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup..All this regardless of Notification Sounds settings and Silent mode. WTF ?..App Icon number:.Not reliably cleared or set on Google Inbox, Outlook, Google Play, to name a few...Note: some of these problems are tied to Notification Sound being off. So, they tied together Sound and Visual part of the notification system. Maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between Visual and Sound Notifications in  Settings. Naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different.  Samsung knows that but they failed to get it right. It's understandable why they failed - read below about the SW update I got.  Anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g. after I change different options) but then get broken again. Classical Samsung.....All in all, I am relying on my Pebble to show me notifications...Some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent. So why Samsung doesn't care ?  Well, just two days into Preorder (I already got my phone) and I get Software Update with important bug fixes. So, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs. They start lots of things, and  rarely nail a single one...First crazy option: Edge screen Notifications. You got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what..Second crazy  option: Turn On screensaver when screen is off. it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ? WTF ?.Third crazy option: Always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that I have notifications... Sure I DO! I receive about hundred or more different notifications daily. The phone is ALWAYS in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one....Fourth crazy option: You can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification. Duh, what about SHOWING that notification...I was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until I fix the notifications to suit my needs. But still, that would leave me with the curved screen;  Curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the LCD. I find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g. Samsung's own S8 Active, Pixel 2 XL with a proper case are easier to handle. So, my argument that I should get S9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore..In addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed. So many broken S8 phones around. I hear they've put much better **glass** into S9.  Duh....And not to forget the screen protector - THERE ARE NO GOOD glass screen protectors on the market (yet). I don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings. Well, that option doesn't work good. I type fast and often use my phone for work email. I can't go and repeat every other letter. Also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen. In fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge...All in all, I am returning this one, and will wait to see what LG G7 will look like. Otherwise, will wait for Pixel 3. Until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than S9...Some notable positive sides:.Samsung Internet browser is just awesome..LCD is excellent. Even better after Apple forcefully reduced the LCD brightness on iphone 7-,  to ""help"" aged batteries. Don't know about iphone X, should be also close to 700nits like this one..Starting camera with double click to Power button..Photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone..Home button is there - just press glass a bit harder..Speakerphone is much louder than Iphone 7...---------------------------------------------------------.UPDATE on screen wake-up on Notification:.Googled a bit to see what can be done. Apparently, people mention that Samsung differs from IOS and stock Android in that you should depend on Edge light, LED light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up. So, Samsung tried to be more clever than Google or Apple. Lets see if they succeeded; I google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues:.1. Some people actually  LIKE that there are no screen wakeup on Notifications. But their screen is WAKING UP ! S6, S7, S8, S9. People suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls..2. Some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them..3. Some people argue why would somebody want to be in Group 2. Duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed..3. Some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings  - ""Wake Up screen on Notifications"". Well, that seems like it, except that I don't have such option..4. There are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications. While Googling, a Verizon help page for S9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... Outlook is installed. Aaaargh. I need that one for work. Anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me..I am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs. Started with Notifications, but I don't know what else is there...",36

1,Defective phone,22-Mar-18,No,"I had the S8 and screens were slipping and sliding/opening and closing.  That was resolved either with an update or one of many calls to Verizon (don't recall.) Also lost audio at 2 1/2 years of owning.  My boyfriend shot some compressed air into the audio part and I could hear much better. But I had already ordered the S9 since I didn't think we could fix the audio on the S8.  I'm having so many issues with it.  I was on the phone with Verizon for 6 hours yesterday - different techs. After exhaustive trouble shooting, it was determined that I got a defective phone!  What are the odds?  When I try to google, email or text, I get knocked out into home screen.  Very frustrating to try 8x to complete a 6 line text.  Perhaps it's that the screen is too sensitive. It's not the apps - we put it in Safe Mode.  We changed everything around including Samsung keyboard to Gboard, thinking that was the problem - wasn't. I'm glad that nobody else got a defective phone who has given a review.  Aren't I the lucky one?  I think I'm still lucky in other ways - it's hit and miss whether you get a functioning phone.  New phone arriving tomorrow and will go to Verizon store for set up as I did with this phone.  Wish me luck please!  Thanks.",9
