1,Dummy phone !!!,10-May-18,Yes,I recieved a display dummy phone this was a major fraud. It was nicely taped in an original iPhone box. When I opened it i saw it was light and thought the sticker (as shown in pictures) was a screen protector. Sadly it wasn't it was a dummy phone. $1300 for a dummy phone. When I called amazon the customer service  staff was stunned I'm so upset !!!!! No stars !!!,82

The home button does need some time to get used to, but once you get used to it the iPhone 6 looks like a caveman's phone with the giant button at the bottom.",0

5,"From a 6S to an X - A wonderful, luxury, phone.",07-Nov-17,No,"I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction...The transition:.NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to  a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand)...Face ID:.I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode...It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google &amp; Facebook)...The price:.There seems to be this running idea that a $1,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree. Why? My logic is as followed: Phone's are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one. If I didn't buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly $2/ a day on a contract with Verizon. The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer. A 128GB 6S at launch was $850. Yes, there's a price difference, but my point is that it's not as gigantic as it may seem. I personally would advocate a 64GB version and utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apple's flagship and there are cheaper iPhone's out there...What I love:.- The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black)..- The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it..- The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store..- I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth..- Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way..- The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera..- The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening..- The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it...What I don't:.Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.",106

We cant use it for its stated purpose and it couldn't be tested till you left the USA. we just need the code to unlock it.

5,Iphone X: A complete re-design and leap forward for Apple.,06-Nov-17,No,"Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically...First off, the set-up process has been significantly streamlined. When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby, select yes, and you can wireless transfer all your apps, settings, backgrounds, passwords, etc. to your new phone in a few clicks. I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X...The other main features that have been upgraded are as follows:.New screen (5.8â€ OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple).- Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7/8 Plus. (See comparison images attached of the iPhone X versus iPhone 7 Plus)..- OLED Screen offers deeper blacks and brighter whites resulting in greater color reproduction..- Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly..- The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors. I thought this would be annoying but Apple has cleverly used the screen real estate on both sides to include the time, date, battery indicators, etc...Farewell Touch-ID, Hello Face-ID.- Face-ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real-estate. This is new and only available on the iPhone X..- Apples facial recognition is light years ahead of Samsung or any other carrier. I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom..- I was worried this feature would be inconsistent or frustrating but it has worked really well. The only time it is a bit more inconvenient is if the phone is sitting on your desk or a flat surface you kind of have to lean over a bit or angle the phone towards you to unlock it..- This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji. This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything..- This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies. The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background..Additional noteworthy features and changes:.- The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization. The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions...- Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images...- Increased audio quality and volume..- Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market...- Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking. A very welcome change in the normal design...- Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus. A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing...- In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones. I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone)...Bottom line, the iPhone X is another smash hit from Apple. Every feature people were concerned about turned out to work flawlessly as usual. I have only had the iPhone for about 24 hours so it is early to leave a long-term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype. The iPhone X may not revolutionize the smart phone industry but it is a welcome upgrade to the iPhone which designs were getting a bit dated. I am excited about Apples new strategy to release a flagship model and allow the new features to trickle down to next generation's phones...If you have the money to spare you won't likely be disappointed. My only complaint is the phone only comes in 64GB or 256GB basically forcing users to pay an extra $150 to get decent storage. Further, the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it. However, a replacement screen will cost you $275+ and the back glass replacement is rumored to cost around $400. Essentially a single drop could result in a $700 repair bill. Unfortunately this means most phones will be shielded in a case and will not be enjoyed.",53

5,"Amazing, Stupendous Phone",22-Dec-17,No,"Full disclosure, I bought my iPhone X yesterday at ATT.  It is not the unlocked one, but as someone who was hesitant to make the switch, I wanted to write a review.  I never get the latest and greatest technology.  I always waited and go the ""s"" version of the new iPhone.  But the pull of longer battery life and a larger screen in a normal size phone overcame my concern of price, a few negative reviews, and to be honest, the stigma of having the most expensive iPhone ever.  I am so glad I did.  This phone is amazing...Highlights:  Great battery life.  On my old iPhone, a 6s, I could get about 4 hours of moderate use before I had to charge, maybe 2 hours of heavy use.  I went all day with moderate to heavy use and used less than 50% of my battery.  The screen is as beautiful as all the people say.  I have found many of my apps have already been updated to take advantage of the screen.  The new gestures are very intuitive and in less than 12 hours I was completely used to them.  Facial recognition is fast and I haven't had a single issue.  I am terrible at taking pictures and this phone makes me look like I know what I am doing.  Though there are a lot of setting options, they are really easy to navigate through.  They say this is the best.smartphone ever, and I have to agree...Negatives:  Because this is so expensive, you might be a little overprotective.  And you should be.  But on my wireless plan, it only increased my payment about $8 month.  I don't find that to really be a negative.  I haven't found anything I don't like about this phone yet...This is a truly awesome phone.",10

1,Dont do it....,14-Apr-18,No,"I returned my iphone x, I'm upset that the screen size wasn't offered in the same frame as the iphone 8 plus. That's ridiculous for the price of this phone, apple of course will release the larger screen size next to around. FACE ID is terrible and there is no finger print sensor either this could have easily been added somewhere on the back of the phone or under the screen. My iphone 7 plus was more advanced than this garbage phone. At this price point I expected much more, I will end up buying the Galaxy s9 plus for now or keep my iphone 7 plus. This phone is a huge disappointment i canf believe they didn't offer a plus size version, this is just Apple's way to grab more money from consumers when they release their next model...I cant recommend this phone to anyone with this price tag, its maybe worth $600 max. My advice would be wait for the next model or buy another phone brand if you really need to upgrade",6
,,,,,
5,Great Phone,17-Mar-18,No,"I bought this phone from apple so that's why it says not verified review but let me get some things out of my chest...Apple has a superior operating system. Period...Samsung, HTC, Pixel can all have better quality cameras or displays or better battery life but apple IOS is light years ahead of android. Android haters like to bash on apple for removing the headphone jack adding the notch (which is barely noticeable) but if you look now there are a lot of phones copying the notch from apple? You tell me...I don't like android because it's buggy. Sure it might run well on super expensive phones like pixel 2 or samsung but it still crashes more often than IOS does...I buy apple phones because of the simplicity of the IOS (not that I'm dumb or can't handle android, I build my own gaming computers). Hardware is nice but operating system is more important in my opinion.",2

Kudos to the Apple store for excellent customer service, though. For $1,200 it should work straight out of the box. It didn't. I'm not going to waste time with troubleshooting or a new one. That money is now back in my pocket.",2

1,iPhone X Defect,11-Nov-17,No,My iPhone X expierence so far. Preordered on Oct. 27th and managed to get a Gray/Black 256GB Iphone X. Finally arrives on the 6th and I don't get a chance to open it up and attempt to hook up my new phone until the 11th. So here I go beaming with excitement to check out my new device that just cost me the equivalent of a house payment. Open it up and everything looks good at first and then I use my iPhone 6S light to look at the screen for any dust as I've already gotten a screen protector in hand to put on my new device before I even get started. Then I see it. A very very small scratch or crack under the screen coming from the notch area at the top of the phone coming down maybe 1/2 a cm long. So I schedule an appointment to talk to an Apple rep. for 8:45am and he finally calls me at 8:48am. I explain to him what I observed on my phone and he doesn't seem to thrilled to help me out today. Maybe because it's a Saturday and he's at work. During our conversation he makes a statement that I didn't really care for. Such as... Maybe the delivery man dropped your package and maybe that's what happened. Obviously this is a manufacturing defect since it's under the screen. So I get two options. Option A) Send my phone in to be repaired and who knows how long that will take and why would I want a brand new item I just paid a lot of money for to be repaired due to a defect. Option B) Go to the Apple Store and have them look at it and I can try and request a new phone. Oh and the next available time I can get an appointment is 4 days away and I'll have to take off work early to resolve an Apple manufacturing defect. So I guess we will see how my Apple Store experience goes. I've had an Apple phone going back to the 3GS days and I've dealt with Apple Customer Service in the past with no issues but so far I'd have to say I'm extremely disappointed in the quality control of the IPhone X and the customer service expierence with Apple. Hopefully all is redeemed on the 14th. To be continued...,63

1,iphone X - Too many cons for me,15-Dec-17,No,"I have had the x for sometime now.  I can say that of all the iphones, the x is my biggest disappointment. I do not always get text messages, my reminders may or may not notify me, I can no longer send a text with the special effects, etc.  This morning my alarm sounded for maybe two seconds and then just shut off.  I have been told to bring it back due to it being a hardware issue.  Now, I get that these things may happen on occasion but the fact that close to 50% of people that I know that did splurge for the x are having issues.  Some, including my husband, are opting not to make a swap because they don't really care about the special effects???  It's more than that.  I feel this product was prematurely released and I not happy.  The not having a home button is an adjustment, can't say I'm a fan.  The face recognition is awful.  I feel that it is a HUGE safety concern.  If someone grabs your phone, be it your child in school and whether it be horsing around or not, they grab the phone and unlock it with your face and run off.  A young mom, walking with a stroller and small toddler in tow, gets mugged, a shopper distracted on their phone and a thug steels it.  These are all legit concerns.  Yes, you can opt to not use it, which my family has done.  I am truly disappointed.  I called Apple customer care and was told that they have received many calls like mine.  The x by far being the most complaints with hardware issues.  Save your money and get the 8 or maybe try another brand but do not waste your money on the x.",25

2,Irreplaceable fragile glass back unacceptable,26-Dec-17,No,"Not a fan of the fragile glass back which costs 550 dollars and a complete disassembly/chassis replacement to fix. That is a massive design failure by making something that should be user replaceable such as the iPhone 4s back. Now I'm left with a shattered phone which can't be fixed. It's a good thing I have a phone case to stop me from cutting my hands, otherwise it would be a safety hazard. FYI, this happened with my case on. If you choose to have Apple fix this issue they will be replacing the entire phone which is environmentally irresponsible and greedy by pocketing 160 of that 550 you paid...Besides that this is a solid phone comparatively, I do like the stainless steel frame over their aluminum from the past but wish that I could omit wireless charging and have the stainless steel material throughout.",5

When this happens, it can not be shutdown either. I must enter the pass-code to unlock. Once it is unlocked with the pass-code, the face ID will work for awhile to unlock the phone.",2

1,Quality Problems with the iPhone X,12-Nov-17,No,just bought an iPhone X for my son in college to replace his iPhone 7+. He called us tonight but the speakerphone quality was horrible. He could hear us fine but it sounded like he was underwater (it was too difficult to understand him so we hung up early). I am quite sure it was not a signal issue as we speak with him every Sunday from his apartment with good signal (AT&amp;T;). My advice is to take your time ordering in case it is a hardware defect that cannot be solved by a software update. Hopefully it is the latter given what I paid for it.,23

5,Own the future of smartphones NOW,23-Nov-17,No,Upgraded from an iPhone 8 Plus. Must say it took some time getting used to the X but I love it. FaceID has worked well over 80 % of the time for me. The OLED screen is beautiful. The notch is not noticeable after you get used to it and distinguishes the iPhone.,3

1,"Don't upgrade, it's a downgrade",18-Mar-18,No,"This is the worst iPhone I've had the miss fortune of having. It malfunctions all the time and doesn't work all the time when you press simple radio buttons for the flash light, very frustrating.",1

1,"The IPhone X is no good ""0""",12-Nov-17,No,"horrible, I sent mine back days after I received mine, ok 1st of all, who would purchase a phone for $1000+ you have to be dumb to buy one, I'm either hoping the 8 is better or I'm getting Samsung which was my 1st thought but then thought about Apple, obviously Apple didn't work out",25
